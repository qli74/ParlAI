If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth.

It can also spead if you touch something that an infected person has touched, like a door knob, elevator button, or bathroom faucet.That's why it's important to wash your hands, avoid touching your face, and practice social distancing to avoid getting sick.

If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time. That is because there are not enough of these masks for health care workers. Health care workers need these masks to stay safe and to take care of sick patients. If you have extra surgical or N95 masks, please donate them to your local healthcare facility.\n",

It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID19 from these surfaces.

      "[Polyencoder]: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others. If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time. That is because there are not enough of these masks for health care workers. Health care workers need these masks to stay safe and to take care of sick patients. If you have extra surgical or N95 masks, please donate them to your local healthcare facility.\n"

If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time. That is because there are not enough of these masks for health care workers. Health care workers need these masks to stay safe and to take care of sick patients. If you have extra surgical or N95 masks, please donate them to your local healthcare facility.\n",

      "[Polyencoder]: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others. If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time. That is because there are not enough of these masks for health care workers. Health care workers need these masks to stay safe and to take care of sick patients. If you have extra surgical or N95 masks, please donate them to your local healthcare facility.\n",

      "[Polyencoder]: Those who are infected with COVID-19 may have little to no symptoms. You may not know you have symptoms of COVID-19 because they are similar to a cold or flu. Symptoms haveincluded:cough fever difficulty breathing pneumonia in both lungsIn severe cases, infection can leadto death.Symptoms may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to COVID-19. This is the longest known incubation period for this disease.Recent evidence indicates that the virus can be transmitted to othersfrom someone who is infected but not showing symptoms. This includes peoplewho:have not yet developed symptoms (pre-symptomatic) never develop symptoms (asymptomatic)While experts know that these kinds of transmissions are happening amongthose in close contact or in close physical settings, it is not known to whatextent. This means it is extremely important to follow the proven preventative measures.Think you might have COVID-19? Take a self-assessment\n",
